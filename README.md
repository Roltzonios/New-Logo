# Infinite-Logo-Marquee-CSS 📺

 Infinite Logo Carousel with only CSS that showcases a continuous loop of logos, with fading gradient effect on the edges of the carousel.

Integrate code on your website to display logos of companies, images, or anything else. It's a really cool animation, using only CSS. No javascript needed!!

## How it works❓

1. **Layout**: The `.wrapper` class contains multiple `.item` elements, each holding an image. You can place your own images under this class.
2. **Positioning**: The logos are positioned absolutely, and their initial position is calculated to be outside the visible area.
3. **Animation**: The `scrollLeft` animation moves the items from right to left. The `animation-delay` ensures that items start scrolling one after another, creating a seamless flow.
4. **Loop**: The `animation-iteration-count: infinite` ensures that the scrolling repeats continuously.

* CSS variables are used for easier reusability and dynamic styling
